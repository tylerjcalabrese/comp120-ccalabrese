# Messages Part 1 Lab

by CR Calabrese, June - 15 - 2021
For Comp 120: Web Programming with Prof. Ming Chow

## Parts Implemented:
All parts of the assignment have been correctly implemented.

NOTE: There is output in the JS console on Firefox because no
favicon is present, but this has nothing to do with my
implementation of the lab.

## Collaborators:
None; I did this lab by myself.

## Time Spent: 
About 30-45 minutes.

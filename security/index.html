      <h1>Security Assessment for Jordan Marsh's Website</h1>
          <p>By C.R. Calabrese, July 7, 2021</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>Jordan Marsh's website, "Not Uber," is a minimalist ride sharing service. Users can request
             rides or post the message that they are offering a ride.</p>
          <p>I was asked to write a report on this site's security practices, noting in particular any
             specific security issues I can find and confirm to be active vulnerabilities of the site.
             I was given the JavaScript code and package.json for the site and asked to find vulnerabilities
             by any methods necessary -- both dynamic and static analysis; and black-box and white-box
             testing. i.e. I looked for vulnerabilities with and without reading the source code; and I
             analyzed the code without running it first, but then dynamically confirmed the vulnerabilites I
             found by testing the actual behavior of the site. </p>
      <h2>Methodology</h2>
          <p>I didn't have a full spec or README for the website readily available to me, besides my familiarity
             with similar
             "Not Uber" rideshare services. So, to start, I needed to get a sense of the site's available
             paths and intended functionality. First, I went to the main page of the site. I got the sense from
             that page that the site had already been compromised. Then I skimmed the source code to see what
             kinds of requests the site will respond to and what the website is supposed to do.</p>
          <p>The code proved to be a promising starting point, and for each path of the site I read the source
             code for inspiration as to what possible vulnerabilities might exist. Then, upon finding a
             suspected vulnerability, I used Postman to test whether I could breach the site.
          </p>
          <p>For further ideas of vulnerabilities to look out for, I referenced Mitre's
             "2020 CWE Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Weaknesses" list.
          </p>
          <p>I used Burp suite's proxy to prevent unwanted redirects and popups put in place by other
             attackers, and OWASP ZAP to scan the site for potential vulnerabilities.
          </p>
      <h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>
          <p>Jordan Marsh's "Not Uber" site has severe vulnerabilites that must be addressed
             immediately.</p>
          <p>Firstly, the main page of the site is vulnerable to cross-site scripting, meaning attackers
             are able to edit the webpage itself and even execute arbitrary code without any
             authorization. I noticed this immediately because attackers had clearly already found this
             vulnerability before I first accessed the site. This is dire because it means
             other scripts (essentially, arbitrary code) could be sourced, destroying
             the site or even spreading malware.</p>
          <p>Secondly, parts of the site that interact with its SQL database are vulnerable to SQL injection,
             meaning that a hacker could craft a special query that does additional, unauthorized things to
             the database. The potential effects of this are very serious, even including the possibility of
             a hacker erasing all of the data in the database or accessing users' confidential information.</p>
          <p>Finally, the list of credentials for the "update" path is hard-coded into the site's JavaScript code,
             meaning if a username is compromised, it will be difficult to fix the breach and attackers will be
             able to bypass the authorization system and insert incorrect information into the vehicles table,
             compromising the usefulness of the site. This also indicates a design flaw in the site, since
             fixing this issue will require that all currently registered users of the site change their usernames.
             When fixing the issue of hard-coded credentials, the authorization system shouls also be changed so
             both a username and password are required. This way, in the event of a breach, the credentials
             can be updated by simply changing the passwords.</p>

      <h2>Issues Found</h2>
          <h3>1: Cross-site scripting on the main page of the site</h3>
          <p>The main page of the website's purpose is to load a list of passengers who are waiting for a
             ride. This seems innocent enough, but the list of passengers comes from a SQL database of 
             passengers that any user can submit to without any authorization. Then, the passenger
             information is not sanitized at all before being rendered as HTML.</p>
          <p>This means more-or-less arbitrary JavaScript code can be executed fairly easily by submitting
             it as a rider's username. For example, by taking advantage of this cross-site scripting
             vulnerability, I was able to make the home page redirect to another URL of my choice. Though
             I chose something fairly innocuous, it still rendered the site unusable -- and a malicious hacker
             could do much worse. Therefore, the severity of this issue is high.</p>
          <img src="images/redirect-how.png" width=500px />
          <img src="images/redirect-result.png" width=500px />
          <p>It's crucial to fix this issue by sanitizing user inputs to the passengers database (in other words, 
             at the /rides path). The most
             straightforward way to alleviate this issue would be to limit the length of passenger usernames.
             Usernames typically don't need to be very long, and if there isn't enough room to fit an
             opening script tag and src attribute, then hackers will not have such a simple way to execute
             their own code on the site. Note that the character limit should be pretty low, to avoid
             hackers using URL shorteners to bypass this.</p>
          <p>Input can also be sanitized by removing characters that are necessary to execute JavaScript
             from this part of the page. For example, the &lt; and &gt; characters typically aren't needed for
             a username, but would prevent an attacker from closing and opening HTML tags using their
             username listing.</p>
          <p>Finally, libraries such as 
             <a href="https://github.com/validatorjs/validator.js">https://github.com/validatorjs/validator.js</a>
             can be used to conveniently sanitize user input and prevent cross-site scripting attacks. For the
             /rides path, writing <code>var username = validator.escape(request.body.username);</code> instead of
             <code>var username = request.body.username;</code> would prevent JavaScript from being executed
             by preventing attackers from opening and closing HTML tags. Whatever script they attempted to use
             would simply show up as a literal string for their username.</p>

          <h3>2: SQL Injection in table queries</h3>
          <p>This issue is rather similar to the first issue, though instead of having to do with the HTML and 
            JavaScript of the webpage itself, it has to do with the server's interaction with its SQL database.
            It occurs in exactly the same manner in the vehicles.json and passenger.json paths. I will refer to
            the vehicles path as my example.</p>
          <p>These routes are meant to allow users to look up all vehicles for the given 
             username. However, because the input isn't sanitized at all, attackers can inject arbitrary SQL
             code into their queries and manipulate the database.</p>
          <p>Below is an example of how one could use SQL injection to access information which they are not meant
             to see, which is all of the vehicles for every user of the site:</p>
          <img src="images/sql-inject.png" width=500px />
          <p>Breach of users' privacy is on its own quite dire. However, attackers could do even worse by
             using a ; in their query to execute multiple SQL statements. Arbitrary SQL could be injected here,
             so an attacker could go so far as to even alter or remove entire tables or schemas, as one of my
             colleagues did earlier today.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, SQL injection, like cross-site scripting, is a common vulnerability and often the
             first thing an attacker will try. Because this vulnerability is so likely to be discovered and can
             lead to breach of users' privacy or even loss or corruption of their data, the severity of this
             vulnerability is high.</p>
          <p>The remedies to this issue are similar to those for the cross-site scripting vulnerability.
             Namely, user input should be sanitized. Again, there should be a character limit on usernames, and
             the query should be truncated to that length as a simple way of cutting back on this issue. If there
             is no room to write syntactically correct SQL, it is much harder for attackers to execute
             arbitrary code.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, as in the other vulnerability, input could be sanitized by removing significant
             characters such as ' and ;. The single quote allows for SQL injection by letting the attacker
             mark the end of the username query string, and the semicolon allows for execution of multiple
             SQL statements by allowing the attacker to end one statement. Though some names include the
             character ', so this policy might be an inconvenience to some users, it is a relatively
             straightforward way to fix this severe vulnerability and would likely be worthwhile.</p>
          <p>Again, the validator library can be used. In this case, <code>validator.blacklist</code>
             should be run on the input to remove the suggested ' and ; characters, as in  
            <code>var usernameEntry = validator.blacklist(request.query.username, "';");</code>. Another
            option would be to use Node JS Postgres SQL parameterized query, the same type that is
            used by the /update path, since this function is designed to reduce susceptibility to SQL
            injection.</p>

          <h3>3: Use of hard-coded credentials for updating vehicle table</h3>
          <p>There is a set of whitelisted usernames that are allowed to update the vehicles table
             in the /update path, but
             that list of permitted usernames is hard-coded into server-vuln.js. This is the "inbound"
             variety of <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html">CWE-798</a>, a member
             of the "2020 CWE Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Weaknesses."</p>
          <p>Though this vulnerability is somewhat severe in that it is a common one, the potential damage
             is much lower because this path
             uses the pgSQL parameterized query functionality to interact with the vehicles table. An
             attacker could use this vulnerability to insert information into the table even though they
             should not be authorized to, which would have serious consequences on the usefulness of the
             website if the data in the vehicles table becomes inaccurate as a result. However, unlike
             the previous vulnerability, arbitrary SQL can't be executed, so the attacker won't be able
             to edit the schema or get unauthorized access to other users' information. Finally, becuase
             this is an example of the "incoming" variant of CWE-798, it is less likely that the average
             attacker will be able to discover it as compared to the "outgoing" variant. That being said,
             once an authorized username is discovered by an attacker and shared with others, it will become
             a widespread, difficult-to-fix issue that many malicious users can update the vehicles table
             by hacking the authorization system -- therefore making the vehicles table (and the entire service)
             useless. Furthermore, some of the usernames will be easily discoverable due to the previous SQL
             injection issue. I  rate the severity of this vulnerability to be medium: It should be fixed before
             attackers are able to discover any of the hard-coded usernames, but until then, the website
             should function as normal. The other two issues are more urgent, especially because this
             vulnerability does not allow for the execution of arbitrary code.</p>
          <p>Below is the list of hard-coded usernames in the server code:</p>
          <img src="images/usernames.png" width=500px />
          <p>Fixing this issue will involve some changes to the overall design of the site as well as
             open communication with the site's current users. First of all, all of these users should be
             notified that their credentials
             may have been compromised and asked to select a new username. Then, credentials should consist
             of both a username and password and should be stored in a secure database rather than hard-coded.
             This way, in the unfortunate event that credentials are compromised at some point in the future,
             passwords can be changed with relatively little hassle, correcting the breach.</p>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>In conclusion, the most obvious and urgent security practice that should be implemented on Jordan
             Marsh's "Not Uber" site is a relatively low-cost one: all user input must be sanitized. This will
             prevent devastating cross-site scripting attacks and can be implemented conveniently using the
             validator library.
          </p>
          <p>Another security practice to consider implementing is using passwords in the authorization system,
             and storing credentials in a secure database rather than hard-coding them into the source code of
             the site. This is still relatively low-cost but will require a minor disruption to current users of
             the site. Though there are inherent costs in communicating to users that the credential system
             needs improvement, this is important to protect their accounts from future, difficult-to-fix
             breaches.</p>
          <p>Finally, a parting word of advice that is not covered in depth in this report is to consider
             the site's susceptibility to DDoS attacks. In my assessment of the site, I didn't notice any
             mechanisms to prevent users from sending a high number of requests to the site, rendering it
             useless. Securing the site against DDoS attacks will likely be more costly and labor-intensive
             than my other recommendations, and is somewhat less urgent to implement, but will be
             worthwhile nonetheless.

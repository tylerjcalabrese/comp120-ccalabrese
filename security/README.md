# Lab 13 : Security and Privacy Assessment
by C.R. Calabrese
July - 7 - 2021
Web Programming with Prof. Ming Chow

## Parts Completed
I've written an outline of index.html and my introduction, and I've identified and written
about two vulnerabilities (though I still need to add code to the resolution portion of
each).

## Collaborators
I haven't collaborated with anybody on this assignment.

## Time Spent
I've spent about two and a half hours so far, much of it trying to figure out Burp Suite and Zap.
